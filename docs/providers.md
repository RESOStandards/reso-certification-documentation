# Endorsements
The RESO Certification process requires a provider (MLS vendor) to review customer (MLS) test results and then notify the customer through the RESO Certification System. The customer will then review the results and approve them to receive certification for the given endorsement.

At this time, there are two possible endorsements that can be issued to data providers, **Data Dictionary 1.7** and **Web API Core 2.0.0**, each of which have different reports.

See more information about viewing **[Endorsements](https://certification-help.reso.org/#endorsements)**.

# Summary Report
[BACK TO TOP](#table-of-contents)

Summary Reports show information about the resources, fields and lookups that were found during certification testing for the organization being viewed.

<br />

Summary Reports for organizations with more than one data provider contain a dropdown at the top of the report for switching between them.

<br />

<br />

Each Summary Report contains two views, **Data Elements** and **Performance**, accessed from a dropdown at the top left of the report.

<br />

<br />

## Data Elements View
The **Data Elements** view shows the counts of fields and lookups found during certification testing, along with how they compare to the industry averages. The counts are broken down by **Advertised** and **Available** data.

<br />

* **Advertised**: the fields and lookups that were found on the server metadata during testing. <br />
* **Available**: the fields and lookups that were found in the data payload during sampling.

<br />

The **Availability Threshold** slider filters the field and lookup counts based on how often they were populated with data during sampling. 

The default availability threshold level shows the field and lookup counts that have an availability greater than zero.

Increasing the availability threshold percentage filters the field and lookup counts to those that are populated with data more often (25% setting shown below).

<br />

<br />

Located below the charts, the **Resources** dropdown menu filters the fields and lookups to the specific resource selected. For example, if Property is selected, chart data will only include Property fields and lookups, with data elements belonging to other resources (e.g., Member, Office, etc.) omitted.

<br />

<br />

The **Data Elements** buttons filter by the following data sets (RESO selection shown below):

* **All** - The combination of RESO + Local<br />
* **RESO** - All resources, fields and lookups matching the RESO Data Dictionary standard<br />
* **Local** - Market-specific custom resources, fields and lookups<br />
* **IDX** - Resources, fields and lookups for public display by an MLS broker participant

<br />

## Performance View

The **Performance** view shows the data providerâ€™s server metrics.

<br />

![image](https://github.com/RESOStandards/reso-certification-help/assets/88680702/0b33d3b1-a12f-452b-a3e1-296d7e48b6ea)

<br />

Performance Reports for organizations with more than one provider contain a dropdown at the top of the report for switching between them.

<br />

<br />

## Performance Metrics
Performance is measured on:
* **Average Payload Size** - how much data was retrieved when sampling the resource selected in the Resources dropdown, with "All" representing the average across all resources found. Measured in megabytes (MB).
* **Average Response Time** - how long, on average, a request to the given server took to complete, measured in seconds (s).
* **Average Throughput** - the payload size divided by response time. Similar to an Internet speed test, this metric shows how quickly consumers might expect to retrieve data from the given server. Measured in megabytes per second (MB/s).
* **Estimated Seconds per 1,000 Records** - the estimated time it takes to retrieve 1,000 records from the server. Shows for the specific provider and the industry average.

**N/A** - means that the given recipient has not completed Data Dictionary availability testing yet.

Please contact RESO at certification@reso.org if you have any questions about interpretting reports.
