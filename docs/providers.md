# Endorsements
The RESO Certification process requires providers (MLS vendors) to review their customersâ€™ (MLSs) testing reports and then use the RESO Certification System to notify them. The customers will then review the results and approve them to receive certification for the given endorsement.

At this time, there are two possible endorsements that can be issued to data providers, **Data Dictionary 1.7** and Web **API Core 2.0.0**, which have different reports available.

After logging in to [certification.reso.org](certification.reso.org), the endorsements are shown under their respective organizations.

There are several sorting and filtering options at the top of the endorsements page.

Filter by typing in an organization name or Unique Organization Identifier (UOI).

Filter to only show your customer organizations.

Filter by endorsement type and certification status.

Sort alphabetically ascending or descending.

The endorsements view includes the current version, a count of data elements (Data Dictionary endorsement), status date and status button.

Select View Details to the right of the endorsement to view the report.

You may also access your endorsements by selecting the Endorsements option at the top of the page. This option is hidden if you are currently on the endorsements page.
