# Notifications
You will receive an email from certification@reso.org with a link to review and approve the results of your certification tests as submitted by your provider. The body of the email will contain a review link for any endorsements that were submitted. 

For example, if both **Data Dictionary 1.7** and **Web API Core 2.0.0** were submitted, they will be reviewed from the same link.

Select the **REVIEW AND APPROVE RESULTS** link located below the endorsement(s) to be taken to the Certification Summary Report.

# Endorsements
The RESO Certification process requires a provider (MLS vendor) to review customer (MLS) testing reports and then notify the customer through the RESO Certification System. The customer will then review the results and approve them to receive certification for any given endorsement.

See more information about [Viewing Endorsements](https://certification-help.reso.org/#endorsements).

# Summary Report
The Certification Summary Report provides a high level overview of the data found during certification testing, displayed in charts. Server performance metrics for the data provider are also included.

Each report contains two views, **Data Elements** and **Performance**, accessed from a dropdown menu in the top left corner.

## Data Elements View
The **Data Elements** view shows the field and lookup counts and how they compare to industry averages. The counts are broken down by **Advertised** and **Available** data.

**Advertised**: the data elements that were found in the server metadata<br />
**Available**: the data element was also found in the data during sampling

The **Availability Threshold** slider on the right allows you to set a minimum data availability that each field and lookup in the data set must be greater than or equal to. The default availability threshold level shows the count of data elements with availability greater than zero.

Located below the charts, the **Resources** dropdown menu provides a data filter to the specific resource selected. For example, if Property is selected, chart data will only include Property fields and lookups. Elements relating to other resources (e.g., Member, Office, etc.) will be omitted.

## Performance View
The **Performance** view shows the data providerâ€™s server metrics.

</BR>

## Performance Metrics
Performance is measured on:

**Payload Size** - measures how much data was retrieved when sampling the selected resource. "All" represents the average across all resources found, measured in megabytes (MB).

**Response Time** - shows how long, on average, a request to the given server took to complete, measured in seconds (s).

**Throughput** - is payload size divided by response time. Similar to an Internet speed test, this metric shows how quickly consumers might expect to retrieve data from the given server. Measured in megabytes per second (MB/s).

**N/A** - means that the given recipient has not completed Data Dictionary availability testing yet. Please contact RESO at certification@reso.org if you have any questions.
